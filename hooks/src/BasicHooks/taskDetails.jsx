// 1. Basic Hooks
// These hooks form the foundation of React functionality.

// Hooks:
// useState: For managing local state in functional components.
// useEffect: For performing side effects like fetching data, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM.
// useContext: For accessing global state using the Context API.
// Task: Weather Dashboard
// Create a weather dashboard that allows users to:
// Search for a city (use useState for the input field and the fetched weather data).
// Display weather details (e.g., temperature, humidity, and wind speed).
// Use useEffect to fetch data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeather) whenever the user searches for a new city.
// Use useContext to manage user preferences like temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit) and apply them across components.
